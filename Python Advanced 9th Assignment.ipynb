Text mode files also handle the BOM for certain encoding types and automatically translate end-of-line sequences to and from the single \\n character on input and output unless this is explicitly disabled; binary-mode files do not perform either of these steps."

If you process Unicode data, the toolset you need has simply moved from 2.X’s unicode and codecs.open() to 3.X’s str and open. If you deal with binary data files, you’ll need to deal with content as bytes objects; since they have a similar interface to 2.X strings, though, the impact should again be minimal.
