    "Classes can support iteration by defining (or inheriting) __getitem__ or __iter__. In all iteration contexts, Python tries to use __iter__ first, which returns an object that supports the iteration protocol with a __next__ method: if no __iter__ is found by inheritance search, Python falls back on the __getitem__ indexing method, which is called repeatedly, with successively higher indexes. If used, the yield statement can create the __next__ method automatically"

The  __str__ is called by the print and str built-in functions,  __repr__ is used in all other contexts: for interactive echoes, the repr function, and nested appearances, as well as by print and str if no __str__ is present.. That is, __repr__ is used everywhere, except by print and str when a __str__ is defined. A __str__ is usually used for user friendly displays; __repr__ gives extra details or the object’s as code form."
